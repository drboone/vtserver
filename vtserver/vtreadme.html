Caveat</A>
</H1>
<P>
Before you even start looking at this software, there are some caveats
which go with it.
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The VTserver software should be considered in alpha release.
Your feedback is most definitely requested, to fix any bugs and to improve
the software.
<DT>2.
<DD>I have never owned or used a real PDP-11. The VTserver software
was developed using a number of PDP-11 emulators. For this reason, there
may be hardware-specific bugs in the software which were not found using the
emulators. As well, the terminology in this manual may not be correct PDP-11
speak. Again, please send me your suggestions and improvements!
</DL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>
<P>
Several members of the PUPS mailing list (see
http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/) have wanted a way of installing UNIX
onto a PDP-11 which has no tape drive. One solution, if the PDP-11 has
software already installed (RT-11, RSX etc.) is to leverage from the
installed software to download and write UNIX onto a spare disk.
This approach is not covered here, and someone who has done this
should be encouraged to write it up.
<P>
The approach here has been to modify the initial UNIX tape loading software
so that bits can be downloaded from a nearby computer over a serial cable.
The modified boot straps thus perceive a <I>Virtual Tape</I> drive; hence
the name of the software.
<P>
The VTserver software comes as two components: a set of PDP-11
software which acts as the client, and the server which is hosted on a
second machine, running Unix.
<P>
The two computers are connected via an RS-232 null modem with hardware
handshaking. A KL/DL-11 unit on the PDP-11 is used as the serial port: the
highest transfer rate is 9,600 bps. Although this is a way to install UNIX on
a PDP-11, its a pretty slow way.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Manifest</A>
</H1>
<P>
The VTserver software is available from
ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/pub/PDP-11/Vtserver as the file <BR>
<TT>vtserver1.0.tar.gz</TT>.
You should have received the following files as part of the VTserver
software:
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>README:</STRONG>
<DD>A quick overview of the software.
<DT><STRONG>vtreadme.txt:</STRONG>
<DD>This document in plain ASCII. There may be an
equivalent PostScript file, <B>vtreadme.ps</B>.
<DT><STRONG>v7_setup.txt:</STRONG>
<DD>The original Bell Labs description on setting up
	7th Edition UNIX. There may be an equivalent PostScript file,
	<B>v7_setup.ps</B>.
<DT><STRONG>unix_license.txt:</STRONG>

</DL>
<P>
Additional files, which are described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vtreadme.html#restofv7">16</A>, are also
available in this directory. You will need at least <TT>v7rootdump</TT>. This
comes as a Gzip'd file, and you will need to unzip it. You probably want to
get all of the .Z files from the FTP site above. Don't uncompress them,
as they can be loaded onto the PDP-11 `as is'.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Required Seventh Edition Manuals</A>
</H1>
<P>
Before you being installing 7th Edition UNIX, you should print out the
original installation instructions. These are contained in the files
<TT>v7_setup.txt</TT> and <TT>v7_setup.ps</TT>. You will need to reference these
instructions when you get to Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vtreadme.html#boot2">10</A>.
<P>
It is a good idea to have the other Seventh Edition UNIX manuals on-hand as you
start using the system. You can install them onto your PDP-11 (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vtreadme.html#restofv7">16</A>), or you can access them over the web at <BR>
<P>
http://www.de.freebsd.org/de/cgi/man.cgi?manpath=Unix+Seventh+Edition
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Compiling <TT>vtserver</TT></A>
</H1>
<P>
The first thing to do is to compile <TT>vtserver.c</TT>:
<P><PRE>
  $ cc -o vtserver vtserver.c
</PRE>
<P>
The code is pretty vanilla ANSI C. The only system-specific section is
that on setting the serial port to raw mode. I have used the Posix
<I>termios</I> system calls, and you may need to port this if your system
isn't Posix-compatible. Please send patches back to me for this.
<P>
The file <TT>.vtrc</TT> is the server's configuration file. Lines beginning
with hashes are ignored. The first (non-hashed) line names the serial
device. Remaining lines name the fictitious tape's records, and should be
<I>boot</I>, <I>cat</I>, <I>tape_contents</I>, <I>mkfs</I>, <I>icheck</I>,
<I>restor</I> and <I>v7rootdump</I>, in that order.
<P>
You will most likely need to change the name of the serial port device.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Connecting the PDP-11 to the <TT>vtserver</TT></A>
</H1>
<P>
The next KL-11 unit after the console (i.e the one at vector 0176500)
needs to be connected via RS-232 to the serial port on the Unix server where
you compiled <TT>vtserver.c</TT>. Ok, I have no experience here as I don't have a
real PDP-11. I'd strongly recommend using a null modem cable with full hardware
handshaking lines (RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR).
<P>
You should configure the KL-11 for 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity, and
you should do the same for the Unix server. On my FreeBSD box, I did:
<P><PRE>
  $ stty -f /dev/ttyid1 9600 cs8 clocal -crtscts
</PRE>
<P>
If you are using hardware handshaking lines (and you should), change this to
<P><PRE>
  $ stty -f /dev/ttyid1 9600 cs8 -clocal crtscts
</PRE>
<P>
I'd also recommend having a copy of Kermit on the Unix server end. If no
communication seems to be taking place, open the serial line with Kermit,
and see if characters are being received from the PDP-11. An RS-232
breakout box here could also be useful.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Starting <TT>vtserver</TT></A>
</H1>
<P><TT>vtserver</TT> is started with no arguments, and reads its configuration
file <TT>.vtrc</TT>. You should have done the serial port settings before this.
<TT>vtserver</TT> starts up with a short description of the tape's contents:
<P><PRE>
  Virtual tape server, Revision: 1.13 
  Records are:
     0 boot
     1 cat
     2 tape_contents
     3 mkfs
     4 icheck
     5 restor
     6 v7rootdump

  Opening port /dev/ttyd1 .... Port open
</PRE>
<P>
It will then sit there waiting for commands from the PDP-11. When commands
are being performed, you will see something like the following:
<P><PRE>
  Opened boot
  qrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqr EOF

  Opened mkfs
  rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
</PRE>
<P>
As each file is opened, it is shown on the screen. `r' signifies a read of
512 bytes. `qr' signifies a read of 512 bytes at boot time. If the PDP-11
tries to read past the file's end, an EOF is shown. Finally, a progress
message is shown every 100K of a file's download.
<P><TT>vtserver</TT> is terminated with a ctrl-C.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">
Tape Records: Original V7 and VTserver</A>
</H1>
<P>
The VT server has virtual tape records which match those on the original
V7 installation tape. One thing to note here is that the <TT>restor</TT> program
is described as being at record 4 in <TT>v7_setup.txt</TT>. With VT server, I
have included the standalone <I>icheck</I> program at record 4. This allows you
to do a rough filesystem check once you have a filesystem on a disk.
<P>
Therefore, <TT>restor</TT> is now at record 5, and the root filesystem dump is at
record 6. Make sure you cross check with the initial <TT>vtserver</TT> screen
(shown above) as you do the installation.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">
Booting via <TT>vtserver</TT></A>
</H1>
<P>
The first stage of the boot process is to hand-enter the boot code which
retrieves the file <TT>boot</TT> from the <TT>vtserver</TT>. This code should
be entered at address 070000 onwards. The code is given in the
<TT>vtboot.pdp</TT>, and in octal below.

<P>
Ok, that's 66 words, which is pretty long. This is my <I>first</I> piece of
PDP-11 assembly code, so if you think you can tighten it up, let me know
and I'll send you the assembly source.
<P>
Toggle in the code, and start execution at address 70000. If all goes well,
you will see ``Opened boot qrqrr...'' from <TT>vtserver</TT>,
and you will receive the following on the PDP-11 console.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">
Second-Stage Bootstrap</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="boot2">&#160;</A>
You should have the following on the PDP-11 console:
<P><PRE>
  New Boot, known devices are hp ht rp rk rl tm vt 
  :
</PRE>
<P>
This is the UNIX second stage bootstrap, slightly modified to name the
devices it knows about. You should now read the file <TT>v7_setup.txt</TT>
(or its PostScript equivalent) as we will be following the boot process
described there.
<P>
At the present, the UNIX second stage bootstrap only knows about:
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>hp:</STRONG>
<DD>RP04, RP05 and RP06 disks.
<DT><STRONG>rp:</STRONG>
<DD>RP03 disks.
<DT><STRONG>rk:</STRONG>
<DD>RK05 disks.
<DT><STRONG>rl:</STRONG>
<DD>RL01 and RL02 disks.

<DD>TU16 or TE16 tape drive.
<DT><STRONG>tm:</STRONG>
<DD>TU10 tape drive.
<DT><STRONG>vt:</STRONG>
<DD>The Virtual Tape drive described here.
</DL>
<P>
If you don't have any of the named disks, you're outta luck. The next
project (perhaps with someone else's help) is to add extra disk devices
to the list. It should be relatively easy to modify the existing boot
code from 2.9BSD or 2.11BSD to work here. The 7th Edition UNIX kernel
would also have to be modified.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">
Filesystem Sizes</A>
</H1>
<P>
For some of the disk types, 7th Edition UNIX reserves space on the boot disk
for swap. Therefore, you must ensure that your root filesystem doesn't
overlap the swap space. Each compiled UNIX kernel has a different idea
where the swap space is. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vtreadme.html#conffiles">17</A> gives the configuration
files for each UNIX kernel image supplied.
<P>
Note that for some disk types, the swap space is on the <B>second</B>
disk unit, and starts at block zero. For these systems, any filesystem
you create on the second disk unit (e.g <TT>/usr</TT>) must come <I>after</I>
the swap space.
<P>
The following table shows you how big the root filesystem can be,
on a device basis.

You need to use the values in the second column when using <TT>mkfs</TT> below.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">
Making a Filesystem</A>
</H1>
<P>
Let's quickly go through the steps of installing the V7 root dump onto
RK05 unit 0. Load the <TT>mkfs</TT> program, and enter a filesystem size of
4000 blocks on rk unit 0:
<P><PRE>
  New Boot, known devices are hp ht rp rk rl tm vt
  : vt(0,3)
  .*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.file sys size: 4000
  file system: rk(0,0)
  isize = 1280
  m/n = 3 500
</PRE>
<P>
The VT tape software prints `.' and `*' alternating as it receives the
512-byte blocks from the <TT>vtserver</TT>. <TT>mkfs</TT> has printed out
the number of i-nodes (1280), and the `M' and `N' values.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION000130000000000000000">
Restoring the Root Filesystem Dump</A>
</H1>
<P>
After <TT>mkfs</TT> has finished, the second stage boot command line should
reappear. You can now run <TT>icheck</TT> (record 4) to verify the filesystem:
use the same disk name as you did before (e.g rk(0,0)).
<P>
With that done, you can restore the root filesystem on to the newly-created
disk system by using <TT>restor</TT> (record 5):
<P><PRE>
  New Boot, known devices are hp ht rp rk rl tm vt
  : vt(0,5)
  *.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*Tape? vt(0,6)
  .Disk? rk(0,0)
  Last chance before scribbling on disk. 
  *.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*. (etc)
</PRE>
<P>
Given the size of the root filesystem, it should take around 45 minutes at
9600 bps to complete the restore.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION000140000000000000000">
Installing Disk Bootstraps</A>
</H1>
<P>
If the restor has worked, you now have a UNIX root filesystem on your disk.
To boot the appropriate kernel for your disk type: type one of the following
at the boot prompt:
<P><PRE>
  New Boot, known devices are hp ht rp rk rl tm vt
  : rk(0,0)rkunix
  : rl(0,0)rl2unix
  : hp(0,0)hptmunix
  : rp(0,0)rptmunix
</PRE>
<P>
You can now follow the rest of the installation instructions in <TT>
v7_setup.txt</TT>.
<P>
One of the first things you should do once you have booted to a shell prompt
is to `cd' into <TT>/dev</TT> and make appropriate devices for your system.
Read <TT>/dev/makefile</TT> and <TT>v7_setup.txt</TT> for details.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Note - I suspect that the `standard' character devices created by the
makefile are not correct for the RL02 UNIX kernel image, as this was built
by someone else. Please let me know if you have troubles with this, and I
will try to build a new <TT>rl2unix</TT>.</I> Below is a listing of <TT>/dev</TT>

This means, for example, that you could use <TT>/dev/hp0</TT> as your root
partition, <TT>/dev/hp1</TT> for <TT>/usr</TT> and <TT>/dev/hp4</TT> for <TT>home</TT>.

The Rest of Seventh Edition</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="restofv7">&#160;</A>
The distributed <TT>v7rootdump</TT> file contains just enough of a root
filesystem to fit into 4,000 disk blocks (i.e an RK05). You will want to
load the rest of the root filesystem, and <TT>/usr</TT>, onto your PDP-11.
<P>
It is up to you to partition your hard disk and mount <TT>/usr</TT> as required.
An optional part of the VTserver software is the rest of the 7th Edition binary
distribution in tar files. These are broken up into small units, because
you'd get frustrated if you had to wait several hours to load a single
file over to the PDP-11 using VT server.
<P>
The available files at the FTP site named above are:
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>v7doc.tar.Z</STRONG>
<DD>contains usr/dict usr/doc usr/man usr/pub usr/spool
and a few files that I couldn't fit onto the root dump.
<DT><STRONG>v7lib.tar.Z</STRONG>
<DD>contains usr/games usr/include usr/lib and the
	/lib/*.a files which again didn't fit onto the root dump.
</DL>
<P>
Note that all of the tarballs have been created so that they can be extracted
from&nbsp; <TT>/</TT>. The distribution does not contain any source code, due to
licensing reasons. The files <TT>v7rootdump</TT>, <TT>v7doc.tar.Z</TT> and
<TT>v7lib.tar.Z</TT> are copyright SCO and you must agree to the binary license
described in the file <TT>unix_license.txt</TT> before you use them.
<P>
I have added two programs for extracting these files to <TT>/bin</TT>:
<TT>uncompress</TT> and <TT>vtcat</TT>. Once you have rebooted and partitioned
your disks, you can used these tools to load the files from the two compressed
tarballs.
<P>
For example, assume you have v7lib.tar.Z as record 7 on the <TT>vtserver</TT>.
[You can shutdown <TT>vtserver</TT>, edit <TT>.vtrc</TT> and restart the server to do
this.] To extract v7lib.tar.Z, do the following commands on the PDP-11:
<P><PRE>
  $ cd /
  $ vtcat /dev/tty1 7 | uncompress | tar vxf -
</PRE>
<P>
For those who are tight on disk space, you can untar both tarballs, and
build new tarballs with only those parts of 7th Edition UNIX you require.
You need to create `old style' tarballs (use the Gnu <TT>tar</TT> -o option), and
compress the tarballs with the -b12 option to <TT>compress</TT>.

System-specific Kernel Configuration Files</A>

Nearly all of the supplied UNIX kernel images were built by someone else.
Below, I give what I believe are the configuration files for each kernel.

Changes from Vanilla 7th Edition UNIX</A>
</H1>
<P>
The following files have been added or changed from the vanilla 7th
Edition UNIX given to the PUPS archive by Henry Spencer.
<P><UL>
<LI> New kernel images <TT>rkunix</TT>, <TT>rl1unix</TT> and <TT>rl2unix</TT>.
<LI> A new directory <TT>/mdec</TT>, with the disk bootstrap blocks.
	<TT>hpuboot</TT> and <TT>rpuboot</TT> come from the directory
	<TT>/usr/mdec</TT>: the others come from a modified UNIX distribution
	given to the PUPS archive by Torsten Hippe.
<LI> A new <TT>/boot</TT> which groks RL02s.
<LI> New programs <TT>/bin/vtcat</TT>, <TT>/bin/compress</TT>, <TT>/bin/uncompress</TT>
	and <TT>/bin/zcat</TT>.
<LI> A new program <TT>/etc/fsck</TT>, from Torsten Hippe, which works on V7
	filesystems.
</UL>
<P>
For those people who have valid source licenses for 7th Edition UNIX, I can
give you the VT modifications to <TT>/usr/src/cmd/standalone</TT>. There are a
few changes to the existing code, plus two new source files: the first stage
bootstrap code, <TT>vtboot.s</TT>, and the VT client code, <TT>vt.c</TT>. I have
also borrowed the <TT>rl.c</TT> code from 2.9BSD, to allow RL02s to be used.
